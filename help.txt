BOA

It is a Streamlit-based web application for analyzing BindCraft output, exploring interface metrics, and visualizing 3D protein structures.

Step 1: Define the target and binder chains. 

Step 2: Clarify the residue numbering offset between the initial target PDB and the final output. 

Step 3: Upload the PDB files and the final_stat_csv file generated by BindCraft.

 After a while, the app provides three tabs: 

1. Summary:
 - Displays all analysed results in an interactive table. 
 - Combines your original CSV with additional metrics computed by MDAnalysis. 
 - Provides buttons to download: 
       • Updated summary CSV 
       • Ranked designs CSV
 - Includes a RESET button to clear all information. 

2. Visualisations: 
 - Interactive 3D structure viewer using py3Dmol. 
 - Customizable chain colouring. 
 - Counts and plots the number of 4 Å contacts between binder and target. 

3. Details: 
 - For each design, you can inspect: 
      • Target and binder sequences
      • Residue–residue contact pairs (3 Å and 4 Å) 
      • H-bond–like interactions
