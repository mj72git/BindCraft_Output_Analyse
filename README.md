# BindCraft Analysis Web App

A Streamlit-based web application for analyzing **BindCraft** output, exploring **interface metrics**, and visualizing **3D protein structures**.

This tool helps you interpret the results generated after running BindCraft, including the Accepted PDB files and the `final_design_stats.csv` file.

---

## Getting Started
### Accessing the bindcraft-output-analysis web app
This application is hosted on Streamlit Cloud, providing easy access without any local installation required. The link :
https://bindcraftoutputanalyse-ednrdmyx97eon4hlfkjatb.streamlit.app/

### Generating BindCraft Analysis Output
To utilize this analysis app, you first need to generate output from BindCraft. The original BindCraft software repository can be found here: https://github.com/martinpacesa/BindCraft.


## 🚀 Features

### ✅ 1. Summary Tab
- Displays all analyzed results in a single interactive table  
- Combines your original CSV with additional metrics computed by MDAnalysis  
- Provides buttons to download:
  - Updated summary CSV  
  - Ranked designs CSV  

---

### ✅ 2. Visualization Tab
- Interactive **3D structure viewer** using *py3Dmol*
- Customizable chain coloring  
- Counts and plots the number of **4 Å contacts** between binder and target  

---

### ✅ 3. Details Tab
For each design, you can inspect:
- Target and binder sequences  
- Residue–residue contact pairs (3 Å and 4 Å)  
- H-bond–like interactions  
- Interface residue counts   

---

## 📁 Input Requirements

Upload the following:

1. **Accepted PDB designs**  
   Output from BindCraft.

2. **`final_design_stats.csv`**  
   The BindCraft metrics file.

The app will automatically match each PDB to its corresponding row in the CSV.
